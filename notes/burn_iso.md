# Burn a ISO image to SD or USB

If you are installing Linux distros or working with Raspberry Pi, you probably need to do this regularly. I have used a bunch of different techniques and always had inconsistent results from Linux. 
However, a new app, [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) seems to make it insanely easy on any OS. 

1. Download Etcher for your system.

2. Download your ISO, for example maybe you want [Raspbian with PIXEL](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) for your Raspberry Pi. You do NOT need to unzip the download!

3. Insert your media, USB stick for Linux live install or SD for Raspberry Pi image. 

4. Start up Etcher. 

5. Select your ISO image (or the archive package containing the image), your drive, and `Flash!`. Wait around for it to finish!
