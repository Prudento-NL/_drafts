`_drafts` is digital rough frame carpentry, a blog of snippets and notes to get things started.

Basically, `_drafts` is a list of gists. 
I write gists to remind myself about little tips and tricks.
This site gathers them together so I can find them.
It's a memory tool. 

`_drafts` is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
